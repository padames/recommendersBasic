# Basic Recommenders
This is publicly available development code used to learn and test concepts and basic ideas about statistical learning in recommender systems.

## Initial outlook

Start with hello world type of examples like the Movie Lens data set to formulate content-based recommendations since there are users with movie selection history that can be given recommendations based precisely on their previous choices. In this process define the utility matrix to compute similarity of previous choices with available ones. Test that you can easily update them when new choices become available. 

Follow with two cases: an item-based collaborative filter and a user-based collaborative filter.

Then test cold-start with a content-based recommender using association rules. 

Then build a hybrid recommender using both strategies.
